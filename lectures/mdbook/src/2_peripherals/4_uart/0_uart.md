# Universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter (UART)
> [...a computer hardware device for asynchronous serial communication in which the data format and transmission speeds are configurable.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter)

- Asynchronous serial communication
- Has been around for a long time
- Uses external clock for precise timing

## Lines
- Transmit (TX)
- Receive (RX)

## Configuration parameters
- Baud rate (bps)
- Parity bit on/off
- 1 or 2 stop bits
- Frame size (5 - 9 bits)

Tradeoffs between speed and error resistance

## Useful for
- Logging
- Modems
