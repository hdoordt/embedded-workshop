# Harware Abstraction Libraries (HALs)

- Hand-written abstraction layer around PAC


- Makes interacting with peripherals a lot easier
```rust,noplaypen
{{#rustdoc_include ../../../../src/bin/hal_pac_structure.rs:pin_init_hal}}
```


- Repository typically contains [examples](https://github.com/nrf-rs/nrf-hal/tree/master/examples)


- Usually no complete API for all of the peripherals
