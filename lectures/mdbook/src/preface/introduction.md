# Introduction
Hello and welcome to Tweede golf's Embedded Rust Workshop! In this workshop, we'll get you started on writing your own embedded software using Rust.

The workshop is divided into separate parts. Each part starts with a lecture, introducing some concepts you'll need to do an assignment. You can do this assignment in your own time and pace, by yourself or along with your peers. Of course, we'll be available for any questions and pointers.

Take a look at the [curriculum](./curriculum.md) to get an idea of what's to come, and, please, before the workshop starts, [**follow the setup instructions**](./setup.md).

The next of the sections are set up as slides, which will be presented during the workshop sessions. They contain links to sources and other explanations, so be sure to use them as reference.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact us.
