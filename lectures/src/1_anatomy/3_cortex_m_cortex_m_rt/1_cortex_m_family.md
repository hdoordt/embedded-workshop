# The arm Cortex-M family

- One of many [arm microarchitectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ARM_microarchitectures)
- Focused on low-power embedded devices
- Current Cortex-M microarchitectures are
    - Cortex-M35P
    - Cortex-M33
    - Cortex-M55
    - Cortex-M23
    - Cortex-M7
    - **Cortex-M4**, which is inside the STM32L476RG

- A chip vendor, like ST, adds their own components to the arm core
- Thus, many different chips share the same core
